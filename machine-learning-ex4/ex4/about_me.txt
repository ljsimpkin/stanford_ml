Hi there! I'm a New Zealander based in Auckland. I am passionate about technology and over the last year explored it in Silicon Valley meeting entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and learnt some useful programming skills. Over our covid lockdown, I've had pleanty of time to explore these interests too, working on image recognition projects, studying machine learning, and replacing my social life with a computer. I joined because I love to spin yarns about business ideas and meet all of you who are working on side projects too. Cheers! https://www.linkedin.com/in/liamsimpkin/2
